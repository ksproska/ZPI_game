Method runs one iteration for genetic algorithm.
        It is split into a couple of steps:
        1. Select two parents
        2. Cross two parents resulting in a new child (which might get "the best genes" from both parents)
        3. Mutate a child (causing some randomization in procedure)
        3. Repeat steps 1-3 until the new generation is the same size as old generation.
        4. Find the best child in new generation and save it.
