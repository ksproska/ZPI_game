This <color='#330099'>DistanceGrid</color> wasn't that bad, don't you think? Now, if you are to learn how does the genetic algorithm work, you need to have a representation of an individual. I assume you know how evolution works. I mean, I hope you paid attention during biology classes before this whole bomb situation.

In our case, an <b>individual</b> is a representation of the shortest route between all cities. Each city can be visited <b>only once</b>, and the trip ends in the city you started with.
In the previous level you assigned numbers, called indices, to each city. Now, the simple representation of one possible route will be the list of indices. As instance, a list that looks like this <b>[1, 3, 2, 0]</b> means we start our trip in the city of index <b>1</b>, travel to city <b>3</b>, then to city <b>2</b>, then <b>0</b>, and we get back to the city <b>1</b>. Simple, innit?
