I must say, I am impressed. You actually managed to get to the last level. I... I never thought you would... I helped you because I wannted to see you fail... I never thought you would actually be able to create a working genetic algorithm...
I am sorry... I never should have been laughing at you in the first place. You showed me that this time it was me who was mistaken. I hope you can forgive me and that you will get to all of your friends safely...
