Hi, my name is <color='#cc6600'>Cryo</color>. Sorry I didn't introduce myself earlier <color='red'><3</color>

In order to find your friends, we need to have a way of saying what are the <b>distances</b> between cities. Let's say you want to get from the city <color='#990000'>Arkantanika</color> to city <color='#336600'>Beltarika</color> and you don't know what the distance is. One solution to the problem is to define a <b>grid</b> with distances between all cities. That way, we will be able to find distances swiftly, simply by specifying names of the cities you want to travel to.
I'm a computer, though, so I don't really wanna be bothered with names. Let's assign an <b>index</b> to each city! That way you can choose the correct distance just by indexing a two-dimensional array!
