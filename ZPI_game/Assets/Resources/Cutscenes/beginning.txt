What should I do now... All I ever wanted was a career in computer science. Have I really asked for too much? Now I can't even tell if my friends are still there!
===
I must find a way to contact them. The radioation levels are not that high. Infrastructure is down, sure, but maybe some of them have found a way to strive in this new reality.
===
I should try to reach out to them! I'll find a solution! I'll find the quickest route to visit all of them! If they are alive, that is...
===
Maybe there is an algorithm that will help me find the shortest route...
===
But how do I do this. I just started my programming assignments and all I have is this piece of junk that barely compiles any code!
===
Heyyyy!! I can hear you, you know?
===
Huh? What is this!
