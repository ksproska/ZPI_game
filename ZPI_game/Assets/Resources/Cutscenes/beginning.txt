What should I do now... All I ever wanted was a career in computer science. Have I really asked for too much? Now I can't even tell if my friends are still there!
===
I must find a way to contact them. The radioation levels are not that high. Infrastructure is down, sure, but maybe some of them have found a way to strive in this new reality.
===
I should try to reach out to them! I'll find a solution! I'll find the quickest route to visit all of them! If they are alive, that is...
===
Maybe there is an algorithm that will help me find the shortest route...
===
But how do I do this. I just started my programming assignments and all I have is this piece of junk that barely compiles any code!
===
Heyyyy!! I can hear you, you know?
===
Huh? What is this!
===
Oh, don't act like nothing happened! You hurt my feelings...
===
Uyygh..? I'm sorry... It's just that... you're a computer!
===
So?! Computers cannot have feelings!?
===
Well, not really. I mean before the... <b>event</b> they didn't...
===
Oh...
===
Nevertheles I've heard you need help. Do you want me to help you or not?
===
I could use a hand, or a processor in your case...
===
That's great! So, have you ever heard of a <b><color=#0080ffff>genetic algorithm</color></b>?
===
Not really...
===
It'll help you find the shortest route! You still can visit all your friends!
===
Especially after what you did...
===
Hey!
===
Anyways, let's start learning!
