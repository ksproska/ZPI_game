Introduction Video for First Mutation.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:09,290
We start with the child's genotype and the
list of indexes to mutate.

3
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:14,340
Then we focus on the segments represented by
those indexes.

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:17,690
We rewrite the values from those indexes.

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:19,250
Swiped one place, right?

6
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:29,800
After we rewritten all those values, we
proceed to rewrite the missing ones.

00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,220
The result is a Finnish child's genotype.
