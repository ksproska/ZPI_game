Introduction video for Partially Matched
Crossover.

2
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:10,020
We start with genotypes of two parents and
two parameters: first index and segment length.

3
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:14,730
For the genotype part specified by those
parameters, we rewrite the values from the

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:19,650
first parent. Now we proceed to fill the
missing values using the second parent.

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,770
First, we look at the indexes that were
already filled.

6
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,550
For each of those indexes, we take the value
from the second parent.

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,830
Look what value is at the same index of the
first parent and search for this value in the

8
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:34,170
second parent. And remember its index.

9
00:00:34,290 --> 00:00:38,520
If that position in the child genome is
empty, we fill it with the value from the

10
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,740
second parent. Otherwise, we continue the
process until we find an empty spot.

11
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:48,330
If the value from the second parent is
already in the child genome, we ignore it.

12
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:53,610
After we are done with the steps for the
segment, we rewrite other unused values from

13
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,660
the second parent.

14
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:59,340
The result is a genotype of a child
necessary for further steps of genetic

15
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,210
algorithm.
