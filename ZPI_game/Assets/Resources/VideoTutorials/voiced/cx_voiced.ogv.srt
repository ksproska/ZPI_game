Introduction Video for Cycle Crossover.

2
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:08,540
We start with genotypes of two parents and
nothing else.

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:14,910
First thing is to find all cycles, select
the first index and the first parent and

4
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,750
check what value is contained in the second
parent at the same index.

5
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,400
Then we'll look for an index and the first
parent containing the previously selected

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:28,560
value. If the value is not yet present in
the cycle, we continue the process.

7
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,810
Otherwise, the cycle is finished.

8
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:42,650
After all, indexes are assigned to a cycle.

9
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:44,690
We can proceed with the next step.

10
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,040
Number all the cycles.

11
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:54,820
If the cyclist number is odd, copy the
values from the index included in the cycle,

12
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,860
from the first bar and otherwise copy the
values from the second parent.

13
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:04,300
The result is a genotype of a child
necessary for further steps of genetic

14
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:04,870
algorithm.
