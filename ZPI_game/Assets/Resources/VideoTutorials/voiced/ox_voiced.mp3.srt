Introduction video for Order Crossover.

00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,320
We start with genotypes of two parents and
two parameters first index and segment length

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,540
for the genotype part specified by those
parameters.

4
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,230
We rewrite the values from the first parent.

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,660
Then we proceed to fill the missing values.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,890
We examine values of succeeding indexes in
the second parent, and if the value is

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,460
missing from the child, we place it in the
first available spot.

8
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:34,270
If the value is already present in the
child, we ignore it.

9
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:54,200
The result is a genotype of a child
necessary for further steps of genetic
