Introduction video for the reverse sequence
mutation.

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,860
We start with the child's genotype and two
parameters first index and segment length.

3
00:00:10,130 --> 00:00:14,210
Then we proceed to reverse order of values
in the selected segment.

4
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,480
After we reversed all the values from the
segment, we rewrite the missing indexes.

5
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:48,020
The result is a finished child genotype.
