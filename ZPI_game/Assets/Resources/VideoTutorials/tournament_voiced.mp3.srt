Introduction Video for Tournament Selector.

2
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:07,100
We start with an entire generation of
individuals.

3
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:10,280
We don't yet look at their scores.

4
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:13,430
Then we proceed to select the subset of
individuals.

5
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:19,760
In the presented example, the subset is 40%
of the entire generation's size.

6
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:25,220
Having a selected subset, we finally look at
the individual's scores.

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,960
The best one in the subset is the winner of
the selection.
